# tcxMidi

MIDI input/output for TrussC, backed by [libremidi](https://github.com/celtera/libremidi)
(CoreMIDI / WinMM / ALSA / WebMIDI). Send and receive notes, control changes,
program changes, pitch bend and sysex, with both an event-callback and a
thread-safe polling API.

## Dependency

libremidi is fetched automatically at configure time via CMake `FetchContent`
(release tarball + SHA256 — **no `git` required**). No manual install.

Per-platform system requirements:

| Platform | Backend  | Status | Extra install / notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------------------|
| macOS    | CoreMIDI | ✅ tested (in/out on a real device) | none (bundled with the OS) |
| Web      | WebMIDI  | ✅ tested in Chrome (input; **no sysex**) | Chromium + https |
| Windows  | WinMM    | ✅ tested (in/out + sysex on a real device) | none |
| Linux    | ALSA     | ⚠️ untested (expected to work) | `libasound2-dev` |
| iOS      | CoreMIDI | ⚠️ untested (auto-enabled; BLE MIDI needs a Bluetooth usage description) | none |
| Android  | AMidi    | 🧪 experimental — enumerates but open is broken (see Android note) | **API 31+** + manifest entries |

JACK / PipeWire / network backends are disabled by default to keep the
dependency footprint small (toggle the `LIBREMIDI_NO_*` options in
`CMakeLists.txt` to re-enable them).

## Quick start

```cpp
#include <tcxMidi.h>
using namespace tcx;

MidiIn  in;
MidiOut out;

void setup() {
    for (auto& d : MidiIn::listDevices())     // enumerate input ports
        logNotice() << d.getPortNumber() << ": " << d.getName();
    in.openPort(0);                   // or in.openPort("Launchpad")
    out.openPort(0);

    // Event API (callback fires on the backend thread — guard shared state!)
    in.onMessage.listen([](MidiMessage& m){
        logNotice("midi") << m.toString();
    });
}

void update() {
    // Polling API (thread-safe, runs on the main thread)
    MidiMessage m;
    while (in.getNextMessage(m)) {
        if (m.isNoteOn()) { /* m.getPitch(), m.getVelocity(), m.getChannel() */ }
    }
}

void draw() {
    out.sendNoteOn(1, 60, 100);       // channel 1, middle C, velocity 100
    out.sendControlChange(1, 7, 64);  // CC#7 (volume)
}
```

## API summary

Enumeration follows the TrussC convention (`AudioEngine::listDevices()` etc.):
`listDevices()` returns `std::vector<MidiDeviceInfo>`, where each
`MidiDeviceInfo` has `getPortNumber()` / `getName()`.

**`MidiIn`** — `listDevices()`, `openPort(index|name)`, `openVirtualPort(name)`,
`closePort()`, `isOpen()`, `getName()` (open port), `getPort()` (open port
number, -1 if virtual), `isVirtual()`, `ignoreTypes(sysex, timing, sensing)`,
`onMessage` event, and the polling trio `hasNewMessage()` / `getNextMessage()` /
`setBufferSize()`.

**`MidiOut`** — `listDevices()`, `openPort(index|name)`, `openVirtualPort(name)`,
`getName()` / `getPort()` / `isVirtual()`, `sendNoteOn/Off`,
`sendControlChange`, `sendProgramChange`, `sendAftertouch`,
`sendPolyAftertouch`, `sendPitchBend` (14-bit, or raw `lsb,msb`), `sendSysex`,
`sendMidiByte`, `sendBytes`, `send(MidiMessage)`.

**`MidiMessage`** — `bytes`, `deltatime` (seconds since previous event),
`portName`, `portNum`, plus `getStatus()`, `getChannel()` (1-16), predicates
`isNoteOn/Off`, `isControlChange`, `isPitchBend`, `isSysex`, and system ones
`isClock`/`isStart`/`isStop`/`isContinue`/`isSongPosition`/`isTimeCode`;
data accessors `getPitch()`, `getVelocity()`, `getControl()`, `getValue()`,
`getPitchBend()`, `getSongPosition()`; `toString()` / `getStatusString()`.

**`MidiClock`** — feed `update(MidiMessage)`; read `getBpm()`, `getBeats()`
(MIDI beats = 16th notes), `getSeconds()`. Tracks tempo from 0xF8 ticks and
song position from SPP.

**`MidiTimecode`** — feed `update(MidiMessage)`; when it returns true, read
`getFrame()` → `MidiTimecodeFrame { hours, minutes, seconds, frames, rate }`
with `toString()` / `getFps()` / `toSeconds()`. Decodes both MTC quarter-frame
and full-frame SysEx.

`MidiStatus` now distinguishes every system message (Sysex, TimeCode,
SongPosPointer, TimeClock, Start, Continue, Stop, ActiveSensing, …), not just a
single lumped Sysex.

**`midiReady()`** — free function; gate port enumeration/opening on it (always
true on native, async on the web — see the Web note below).

Channel numbers are **1-16** throughout.

## Threading note

`MidiIn::onMessage` is invoked on libremidi's input thread, **not** the main
(update/draw) thread. Guard any shared data with a mutex, or use the polling
API and drain `getNextMessage()` from `update()` (what the examples do).

## Windows note

The backend is **WinMM**. A USB device that exposes several MIDI ports (e.g. the
Launchpad Mini Mk3's *DAW* + *MIDI* ports) appears as one port per jack, and
WinMM renames every port after the first to `MIDIIN2 (<name>)` /
`MIDIOUT2 (<name>)`. The index and parentheses are added by **Windows, not the
device**, and the original jack labels (e.g. "DAW" / "MIDI") are lost — so
`openPort(name)` matching that works on macOS/Linux may need a different string
on Windows. WinMM also truncates port names to **31 characters**. When in doubt,
print `listDevices()` and match on what you actually see.

## Web (Emscripten) note

Web MIDI works in **Chromium-based browsers over https** (Safari/Firefox have
no Web MIDI). It is **asynchronous**: `navigator.requestMIDIAccess()` resolves a
frame or more after launch, and touching libremidi before then crashes. Don't
open ports in `setup()` — gate on `midiReady()` from `update()`:

```cpp
if (!started_ && midiReady()) { started_ = true; midiIn_.openPort(0); }
```

`midiReady()` is always true on native, so the same code runs everywhere (the
examples all use this pattern). On the web the access is requested **without
sysex**, so sysex (e.g. Launchpad Programmer mode) is native-only.

## Android note

> **Status: experimental.** Device *enumeration* works (`listDevices()` returns
> the connected device), but *opening* a port currently fails inside libremidi's
> AMidi backend on recent Android: it can't find the `MidiDeviceCallback` class
> from its native thread (JNI classloader) and reports empty port names. So
> Android builds and enumerates, but send/receive isn't functional yet — it
> needs upstream libremidi fixes. The notes below are for when that lands.

libremidi's Android backend uses **AMidi**, which requires **API level 31+**
(Android 12+) and a small Java glue class. tcxMidi handles most of it:

- The Java glue (`dev.celtera.libremidi.MidiDeviceCallback`) ships in
  `tcxMidi/android/java/` and is compiled into the APK automatically by TrussC's
  addon aggregation — you don't add it yourself.
- The MIDI manifest lines ship in `tcxMidi/android/manifest/uses.xml`. They are
  **not** injected automatically: at configure time TrussC collects them into
  `build-android/REQUIRED_MANIFEST_SNIPPET.xml` and prints a NOTICE. Paste the
  ones you need (MIDI feature, USB host, BLE permissions) into your app's
  `AndroidManifest.xml`.

You must set the build to API 31+ yourself: trusscli currently hardcodes
`ANDROID_PLATFORM: android-26` in `CMakePresets.json`, so bump it to
`android-31` (the bundled `example-basic` preset is already set to 31). Building
on android-26 fails configure with *"AMidi API requires API level 31+"*.

BLE MIDI additionally needs the `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` / `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` runtime
permissions requested at runtime, and the device paired/connected at the OS
level (raw CoreMIDI/AMidi sees it once the system has connected it).

## Examples

Generic examples (work with any MIDI device):

- **example-basic** — the smallest usage and the most universal tool: opens the
  first in/out port, shows a scrolling history of incoming messages, SPACE
  sends a note. Watch the log to learn what each control on your device sends.
- **example-async** — the same monitor, but driven asynchronously by the
  `onMessage` event (callback on the MIDI thread) instead of polling, showing
  the correct mutex-guarded pattern for handling messages off the main thread.
- **example-keyboard** — a piano-keyboard visualizer. Note numbers are standard
  pitches, so held keys light up the same on any keyboard (velocity = brightness).
- **example-controller** — knob/fader monitor: every CC number that arrives gets
  a labelled meter that animates to its value. Move a control, a bar appears.

Device-specific demos live in their own repos (they only make sense with that
hardware):

- **[trussc-launchpadMiniMk3-demo](https://github.com/tettou771/trussc-launchpadMiniMk3-demo)**
  — Novation Launchpad Mini Mk3: paint / sequencer / ripple modes with LED
  feedback and ChipSound audio.
